⚠️ Disclaimer  This tool and all its modules are intended for educational and ethical cybersecurity testing only. Do NOT use this tool on any system without explicit authorization.

1. XSS (Cross-Site Scripting Scanner)

This module scans web applications to identify input points that may be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
It helps detect improper input validation and output encoding issues that could allow malicious scripts to be injected.
Intended strictly for educational and defensive security testing purposes.

2. SQL-i (Structured Query Language Injection Scanner)

This scanner checks whether a web application safely handles database queries.
It attempts to identify weak input handling that could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
Designed to support secure coding practices and security learning only.

3. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing Misconfiguration Scanner)

This module analyzes CORS headers and policies to detect insecure or misconfigured cross-origin access.
It helps determine whether unauthorized domains may be allowed to access sensitive resources.
Used for security assessment and awareness, not exploitation.

4. OS Command Injection Scanner

This scanner looks for parameters that may allow unintended execution of operating system commands.
It evaluates whether user input is properly validated before being passed to system-level functions.
Strictly for educational and defensive testing scenarios.

5. LFI (Local File Inclusion) Scanner

This module checks whether a web application is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion due to improper file path handling.
It helps identify cases where sensitive local files might be exposed.
Intended for security testing and learning purposes only.

6. RFI (Remote File Inclusion) Scanner

This scanner detects insecure configurations that may allow remote files to be included by the application.
It is used to identify potential risks caused by unsafe file inclusion mechanisms.
For educational and secure development awareness only.

7. Path Traversal Scanner

This module tests whether user input can be used to traverse directories and access unauthorized files.
It helps identify insufficient path validation in file handling logic.
Used solely for vulnerability identification and education.

8. Open Redirect Scanner

This scanner identifies unsafe redirection mechanisms that could be abused for phishing or social engineering attacks.
It checks whether user-controlled input is used in redirect URLs without proper validation.
For ethical security testing and awareness only.

9. GitHub Recon (Scanner)

This module performs reconnaissance on publicly available GitHub data.
It helps identify accidentally exposed information such as configuration files, credentials, or sensitive references.
Designed for OSINT learning and secure development practices.
